    What is Java?
   	   - Java is an Object-Oriented, Class-based, Secured and general purpose computer-programming
         language, which is used to develop mobile applications, desktop applications etc,.
       - Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications
       - Java works on different platforms, and it is open source and free.
       - Java developed by Sun Micro Systems in the year 1995.
       - James Gosling is known the father of java.
       - before Java Its names was Oak. Since Oak was already registered company,
         so james gosling and his team changes the name form Oak to Java.
       - The Latest Version of Java is JDK21 from SEP 2023.
       - The Oracle Corporation is the current owner of Java followed by Sun Micro Systems on 27 June, 2010.
       - Java is a Write-Once Run-Anywhere Language, meaning that compiled java code can run on all platforms
         that supports Java with out need of Re-Compilation, that's why java is a platform independent.
         
   Explain the working of Java Programme?
   	- The source code converts into byte code by using a compiler and the byte-code can be run on jvm
   	  and the jvm interprets the byte-code and executes the program.
   
   Applications of Java
   	- There are Four Types of Applications in Java
   		- Standalone applications [ desktop applications like media player and anti virus]
   		- Web Applications [Servlet JSP Spring and Hibernate applications]
   		- Enterprise Applications [Banking Applications]
   		- Mobile Applications [Anroid Applications]
   
   Java Platforms/Edtions
   	- There are Four Types of Edtions in Java
   		- Java Standard Edtion [ Java SE ]
  		- Java Enterprise Editon [ Java EE ]
   		- Java Micro Edition [ Java ME ]
   		- Java FX [ Internet Applications ]
 
   Features of Java
   	- Platform Independent
   	- Objected Oriented Language
  	- Fast & Secure
   	- Simple & Portable
   	- Robust [ Realiable ]
   	- Dynamic
   	- Interpreted
  	- Distributed
  	- Write-Once Run Anywhere
    
    JVM JRE JDK 
    
    JVM - Java Virtual Machine is an abstract, it is a virtual machince does not physically exist.
        - The main function of JVM is to execute the byte-code produced by the compiler.
        - It can also run those programes which are written in other languages and compiles to java byte-code.
        - The JVM performs the main tasks
            1. Loads Code
            2. Verifies Code
            3. Executes Code
            4. Provides Run-Time Environment
           
    JRE - Java Run-Time Environment is a set of software tools which are used to developing java applications.
        - JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet support and plugins for running the Java Program.
        - It is an implementation of the JVM which physically exists.
       
    JDK - Java Development Kit is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets.
    	 - It is the tool necessary to compile, document and package java programs
    	 - The JDK contains a private JVM amd a few other resources such as an interpreter/folder, a compiler,
          an archiver, a documentation generator etc to complete the development of application.
      
    IDE - Integrated Development Environment
        - IDE is a software application that provides feasibility to users in writing and debugging java programs.
        - The most important IDEs are Eclipse, VS Code, Intellij etc,.
