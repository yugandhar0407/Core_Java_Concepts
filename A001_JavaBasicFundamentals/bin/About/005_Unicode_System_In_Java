Unicode System
		--> Unicode system is a universal international standard character encoding that is capable
		    of representing most of the world's written languages.
		--> Before unicode, there are so many languages like ASCII, ISO8859-1, KOI-8, etc.
		--> But these are creating some problems, so to slove these problems unicode system is introduced.
		--> It holds 2 bytes, so java used 2 bytes for characters.
