Operators In Java
		Operator in java is a symbol that is used to perform operations.
		
		
	Types of Operators
		Unary Operator
		Arithmetic Operator
		Shift Operator
		Relational Operator
		Bitwise Operator
		Logical Operator
		Ternary Operator
		Assignment Operator
		
	Unary Operators:
			The Java Unary Operators require only one operand.
			Unary operators are used to perform various operations i.e.,
				* Incrementing/decrementing a value by one
				* negating an expression
				* inverting the value of a boolean
				
	Arithmetic Operators
			Java arithmetic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
			These are basic mathematical operations.
			
	Shift Operator
		Left Shift Operator
			The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a 
			specified number of times.
		Right Shift Operator
			The Java right shift operator >> is used to move the value of the left operand to right by the
			number of bits specified by the right operand.
			
	Java And [&] Operator
		Logical [&&]
			The Logical && operator doesn't check the second condition if the first condition is false.
			It checks the second condition only if the first one is true.
		Bitwise [&]
			The Bitwise & operator always check the both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
			
	Java Or [|] Operator
		Logical [||]
			The Logical || operator doesn't check the second condition if the first condition is true.
			It checks the second condition only if the first one is false.
		Bitwise [|]
			The Bitwise | operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
			
	Ternary Operator
			Java Ternary Operator is used as one line replacement for if-then-else statement 
			and used a lot in Java Programming.
			It is the only conditional operator which takes three operands.
			1. Condition?
			2. Expression 1:
			3. Expression 2:
			It allows to evaluate a boolean expressions (true or false)
			
	Assignment Operators
			Assignment Operators are a binary operator that is used to assign a value of an
			expression to a variable on the left hand side of the operator, 
			with the result of the value on the right side of the equal.
