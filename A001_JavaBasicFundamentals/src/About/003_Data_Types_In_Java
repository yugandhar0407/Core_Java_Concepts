 Data Type - Data Types specifies the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable.
   			Data Types helps in memory management. 
               It helps to assign the memory depending upon the type of data type.
   			Basic definition of data type is a data storage format that can contain 
               a specific type of range values.
               When Data store in variable, each variables assigned specific data type.
               
   Types of Data Types - Primitive data types 
                         Non-Primitive data types or Object data types
                         
   Primitive Data Types
                       - Primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation.
                       - These are the most basic data types available in java language
                       - There are Eight types of data type
                         1. Boolean
                         2. Byte
                         3. Char
                         4. Short
                         5. Int
                         6. Long
                         7. Float
                         8. Double
                        
   Non-Primitive Data Types
   		       - Non-Primitive data types are called reference data types because 
                         they refer to objects.
                       - Non-Primitive data types are created by the programmer and
                         is not defined by java (except String).
                       - The Non-Primitive data types are 
                         1. Strings
                         2. Arrays
                         3. Classes
                         4. Interfaces
                         
          DataType  Default value    Default  Size                  Range
		  
		  boolean - false            1bit                          - 
		  
		  byte -    0                1 byte/8 bits                 -128 to 127
		  
		  short -   0                2 byte/16 bits                -32768 to 32767 
		  
		  int       0                4 byte/32 bits                -2147483648 to 2147483647
		  
		  long      0L               8 byte/64 bits                -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
		  
		  float     0.0f             4 byte/32 bits                -3.4e -038 to 3.4e + 038
		  
		  double    0.0d             8 byte/64 bits                 unlimited
		  
		  char                       2 byte/16 bits                '\u0000' to '\uffff'
