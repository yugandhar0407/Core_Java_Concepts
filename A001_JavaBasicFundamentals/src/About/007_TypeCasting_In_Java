             - Type Casting is the process of converting a variable of one data type to another data type.
   
Types of Type Casting
			  1. Implicit Type Casting
			  2. Explicit Type Casting

1. Implicit Type Casting
             - Implicit Type Casting is also known as widening or Automatic type .
             - When a small range of data type variable is converted into a large range daya type variable.
               this process is called "Implicit Type Casting".
               
               byte - short - int - long - float - double
               
2. Explicit Type Casting
			 - Explicit Type Casting is also known as narrowing typecasting
			 - When a large range data type is converted into small range data type 
			   is known as "Explicit Type Casting".
			   
			   double - float - long - int - short - byte
