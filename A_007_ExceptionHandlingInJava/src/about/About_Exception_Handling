	Exception Handling In Java

		The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime
		errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.
		
		Exception --> Abnormal Condition
		
		In Java, Exception allows us to write good quality codes where the errors are checked at the compile
		time instead of runtime and we can create custom exceptions making the code recovery and debugging easier.
		
		In Java an Exception is an event that distrupts the normal flow of the program.
		It is an object which is thrown at runtime.
		
		Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFound Exception,
		IOException, SQL Exception, Remote Exception etc,.
		
	Hierarchy of Java Exception Classes
		The java.lang.Throwable class is the root class of Java Exception Hierarchy inherited by two 
		subclasses.
		
									Throwable
									
			Exception                                           Error
					-IOException									-StackOverFlow Error
					-SQLException									-VirtualMachine Error
					-ClassNotFoundException							-OutOfMemory Error
					-RuntimeException
								-Arithemetic Exception
								-NullPointer Exception
								-NumberFormat Exception
								-IndexOutOfBoundsException
													-ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
													-StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
	
	Types Of Java Exceptions
		According to oracle, three types
		1.Checked Exception
		2.Unchecked Exception
		
	1. Checked Exception
			The Classes that directly inherit the throwable class except Runtime Exception and error are known
			checked Exceptions.
			Ex: IOException, SQL Exception etc,.
			Checked Exceptions are checked at compile time.
	2. Unchecked Exception
			The Classes that inherit the Runtime Exception are known as unchecked Exception.
			Ex: Arithmetic Exception, NullPointer Exception, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception.
			Unchecked Exceptions are not checked at compile time, but they are checked at runtime.
			
	The Main Keywords in Exceptions are 
						* try
						* catch
						* finally
						* throw
						* throws
						
	Try: 		In Java, the try keyword is used to define a block of code that may throw an exception. 
			The try block is the first step in constructing an exception handler.
			The try block contains code that may throw an exception. 
			If an exception occurs in the try block, the catch block handles it.
	
	Finally:
			The finally block is the block that always gets executed no matter the program throws an exeception
			or not.
			Java finally block is a block used to executed important code such as closing the connection etc,.
			The finally block follows the try/catch block.
			
		Note: for each try block there can be zero or more catch blocks,but only one finally block.
		
	Throw:
			The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
			
	Throws:
			The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
			It gives an information to the programmer that they may occur an exception.
			
			throws are used to suppress the error if the user doesn't want to specify the try and catch block.
			
						
	Common seenarios of Java Exceptions.
	
			int a = 50/0                     --> Arithmetic Exceptions.
			
			String s = null;
			System.out.println(s.length());  --> Null Pointer Exception
			
			String s = "abc";
			int i = Integer.parseInt(s);     --> Number Format Exception
			
			int a[] = new int[5]'
			a[10] = 50;                      --> Array Index Out Of Bounds Exception.
